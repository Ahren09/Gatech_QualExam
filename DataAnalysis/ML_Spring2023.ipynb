    "In many real-world scenarios our data has millions of dimensions, but a given example has only hundreds of non-zero features. For example, in document analysis with word counts for features, our dictionary may have millions of words, but a given document has only hundreds of unique words. In this question we will make $l_2$ regularized SGD efficient when our input data is sparse. Recall that in $l_2$ regularized logistic regression, we want to maximize the following objective (in this problem we have excluded $w_0$ for simplicity):\n",

    "(4) [4pts] Now let us consider a toy machine learning task in generative modeling, where we have a dataset that follows a bimodal distribution $p(X)$, as illustrated in Figure 1. Our goal is to approximate the real distribution $p(X)$ with a model distribution $q_\\theta(X)$. For simplicity, we restrict the $q_\\theta(X)$ to normal distributions, i.e., $q_\\theta(X)=\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu, \\sigma^2\\right)$. Since we want to approximate $p(X)$ using $q_\\theta(X)$, a natural objective function is to minimize the KL divergence between these two probability distributions. Here, we have two options for the objective, i.e., $\\min _\\theta K L\\left(p \\| q_\\theta\\right)$ or $\\min _\\theta K L\\left(q_\\theta \\| p\\right)$. For each of the two choices, draw the density curve of $q_\\theta$ that could be obtained by minimizing the corresponding KL divergence, and explain your answers."

    "When we are minimizing $KL(p \\| q_\\theta)$, we are trying to find a model distribution $q_\\theta$ such that the expected log-likelihood under the true distribution $p(X)$ is maximized. This is equivalent to minimizing the expected surprise when $q_\\theta$ is used to approximate $p$. This approach might result in a $q_\\theta$ that is more \"spread out\" to cover the support of $p(X)$ to avoid assigning low probability to any outcome that $p(X)$ might generate.\n",

    "On the other hand, minimizing $KL(q_\\theta \\| p)$ means we are trying to find a model distribution $q_\\theta$ that is as close as possible to the true distribution $p$ in terms of the log-likelihood of $q_\\theta$. This approach tends to produce a $q_\\theta$ that focuses on the modes of $p(X)$, potentially ignoring regions where $p(X)$ has low probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a bimodal distribution like the one in Figure 1, minimizing $KL(p \\| q_\\theta)$ would likely result in a $q_\\theta$ that has a broader spread to cover both modes of $p(X)$, even if it means the peak of $q_\\theta$ is not exactly at the peaks of $p(X)$. The density curve of $q_\\theta$ would have to be wider than the individual modes of $p(X)$ to ensure it does not assign low probability to outcomes where $p(X)$ has significant mass.\n",

    "Minimizing $KL(q_\\theta \\| p)$, however, would result in a $q_\\theta$ that closely matches the peaks of $p(X)$ because it's trying to maximize the likelihood of the data that is actually observed. This means $q_\\theta$ may focus on one of the modes of $p(X)$, giving a tighter fit around that mode but possibly ignoring the other mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the actual shapes of $q_\\theta$ obtained by minimizing each KL divergence would depend on the initial parameters and the optimization procedure. It's also worth noting that using a single normal distribution to approximate a bimodal distribution is a simplification that may not capture the true nature of $p(X)$. A mixture of Gaussians would typically be a better model for such a distribution. \n",
