    "## 1. Probabilistic PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "The formulation of PCA was based on a linear projection of the data onto a subspace of lower dimensionality than the original data space. It can be shown that PCA can also be expressed as the maximum likelihood solution of a probabilistic latent variable model. This reformulation of PCA, known as probabilistic PCA (PPCA). PPCA is a simple example of the linear-Gaussian framework, in which all of the marginal and conditional distributions are Gaussian. We can formulate PPCA by first introducing an explicit latent variable $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M \\times 1}$ corresponding to the principal-component subspace. Next we define a Gaussian prior distribution $p(z)$ over the latent variable, together with a Gaussian conditional distribution $p(x \\mid z)$ for the observed variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D \\times 1}$ conditioned on the value of the latent variable. Specifically, the prior distribution over $z$ is given by a zero-mean unit-covariance Gaussian $p(z)=\\mathcal{N}(z \\mid 0, \\mathbf{I})$. Similarly, the conditional distribution of the observed variable $x$, conditioned on the value of the latent variable $z$, is again Gaussian, of the form $p(x \\mid z)=\\mathcal{N}\\left(x \\mid \\mathbf{W} z+\\mu, \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I}\\right)$ in which the mean of $x$ is a general linear function of $z$ governed by the $D \\times M$ matrix $\\mathbf{W}$ and the D-dimensional vector $\\mu$. All $\\mu, \\mathrm{W}$ and $\\sigma^2$ are unknown parameters."

    "The perceptron, being a fundamental unit of neural networks, operates as a linear classifier. This means it separates input space with a linear boundary. To understand why a single perceptron can compute logical AND and OR functions but not XOR, let's consider each function in the context of a perceptron.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logical AND**: In the case of the AND function, the output is true (1) if and only if both inputs are true (1). This can be visualized as a linear separation where only the point (1,1) is classified as 1 and the rest (0,0), (0,1), and (1,0) are classified as 0. A single perceptron can learn this linear boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Logical OR**: Similarly, for the OR function, the output is true if either of the inputs is true. Here, the points (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1) are classified as 1, and only (0,0) is classified as 0. This is also a linearly separable problem, and a single perceptron can learn to classify this correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Logical XOR**: The XOR function outputs true if the inputs are different (i.e., one is true, the other is false). In this case, (1,0) and (0,1) should be classified as 1, while (0,0) and (1,1) should be 0. If you try to visualize this on a 2D plane, you'll see that there is no single straight line that can separate the points (1,0) and (0,1) from (0,0) and (1,1). Since a perceptron can only draw a linear boundary, it fails to classify the XOR function correctly. This is a classic example of a problem that is not linearly separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the limitation of a single perceptron in computing XOR lies in its nature as a linear classifier. XOR represents a problem that requires a non-linear solution, which a single perceptron is not capable of providing. This limitation led to the development of multi-layer networks and the concept of hidden layers, which can capture non-linear relationships.\n",

    "Excluding regularization from the bias terms when training a neural network is a common practice for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preventing Underfitting**: Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, are used to penalize large weights in a neural network, helping to prevent overfitting by discouraging overly complex models. However, bias terms do not contribute to the complexity of the model in the same way that weights do. The primary role of bias is to provide an additional degree of freedom in fitting the model to the data, allowing the activation function to shift left or right. Regularizing these bias terms could lead to underfitting, as it would unnecessarily restrict the model's ability to fit the data properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Controlling Model Complexity**: The complexity of a model is typically controlled by the weights connecting the inputs to the outputs, which determine how input features are combined and transformed. Regularizing these weights helps to simplify the model. Bias terms, on the other hand, simply adjust the output level and do not interact with input features in a multiplicative manner. Therefore, regularizing biases has a minimal impact on controlling model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Maintaining Model Representational Power**: Regularizing bias terms could diminish the representational power of a neural network. Since biases allow each neuron to learn an appropriate threshold, regularizing them could prevent neurons from learning these thresholds effectively, especially in deeper networks where this could have a cascading effect across layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, excluding regularization from bias terms helps in maintaining the right balance between model complexity and fitting ability, ensuring the model is neither overfit nor underfit while retaining its representational power.\n",
