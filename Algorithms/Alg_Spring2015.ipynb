    "The classical Traveling Salesperson Problem requires to input a weighted undirected graph and find a minimum-weight cycle that includes all vertices of the graph. We consider the modified version of the problem, which requires to find a minimum-weight path through all vertices; that is, the salesperson has to visit all vertices without returning to the initial vertex. The classical Traveling Salesperson Problem is known to be NP-complete. Use this fact to prove that the modified problem is also NP-complete.\n"

    "The constructed new graph is $G' = (V \\cup \\{v'\\}, E')$. In $G'$, any path that includes the vertex $v'$ more than once will have an extremely large weight due to the large weights of the edges connected to v'. Therefore, the minimum-weight path that visits every vertex in $G'$ exactly once will include $v'$ exactly once and form a path through all original vertices of $G$ and back to v'. This will form a Hamiltonian cycle in $G'$. We can thus solve the classical TSP on G by simply removing $v'$ and its incident edges from the solution. \n",
