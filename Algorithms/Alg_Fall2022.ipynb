    "## 1. Greedy \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following job scheduling problem:\n",
    "You have $n$ jobs $J_1, J_2, \\ldots, J_n$, one supercomputer and $n$ identical PCs. Each jobs needs to be first preprocessed on the supercomputer, and then it needs to be finished on one of the PCs. Job $J_i$ needs $p_i$ seconds of time on the supercomputer, followed by $f_i$ seconds of time on a PC.\n",
    "Since there are $n$ PCs, the finishing of the jobs can be performed fully in parallel, where each PC can process one job. However, the supercomputer can only work on a single job at a time, so you need to work out an order in which to schedule the jobs to the supercomputer. As soon as a job is done on the supercomputer, it can be handed off to a PC for finishing, and the supercomputer can start to process the next job.\n",
    "\n",
    "The completion time of all jobs is the earliest time at which all jobs will have finished processing on the PCs. Describe a greedy algorithm which produces a schedule that minimizes the completion time, and prove the correctness of your algorithm. Your proof of correctness can use an exchange argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"color:blue\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "1. Sort the jobs in non-increasing order based on their PC processing times $f_i$ (So the job with the longest running time on the PC will be first processed on the supercomputer).\n",
    "2. Process the jobs on the supercomputer in this order.\n",
    "3. As soon as a job finishes preprocessing on the supercomputer, hand it off to a PC for finishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof of Correctness:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove the correctness of the algorithm, we'll use an exchange argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there exists an optimal order $O$ which is different from our greedy order $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll show that we can always modify $O$ to create a schedule with an even shorter completion time, which contradicts the assumption that $O$ is optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the first jobs that differ are $J_x$ in $G$ and $J_y$ in $O$ where the processing time on the PC for $J_x$ is $f_x$ and for $J_y$ is $f_y$. Since the greedy algorithm always chooses the job with the greatest $f_i$ to run first, we have $f_x \\geq f_y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider switching $J_x$ and $J_y$ in the optimal order $O$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The increase in completion time due to $J_y$ coming later in $O$ is at most $f_y$, since $J_y$ is processed immediately after the supercomputer finishes and then takes $f_y$ time on the PC. However, the decrease in completion time for moving $J_x$ earlier is at least $f_x$ which is greater than or equal to $f_y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the completion time of any jobs on the  supercomputer won't be delayed by the exchange, as $J_y$ has a shorter processing time on the supercomputer than $J_x$ (since it has a shorter finishing time on the PCs).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, by making this switch, we either improve the schedule or it remains the same. This means that our greedy algorithm produces a schedule which is at least as good as any other possible order.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can be repeated for any discrepancies between $G$ and $O$, meaning our greedy algorithm is optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, our greedy algorithm does indeed produce a schedule that minimizes the completion time.\n",

    "For Double-SAT problem, given a boolean formula $\\phi$ and two assignments of variables from $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$, we can check in polynomial time whether both assignments evaluate $\\phi$ to be TRUE. Thus, DOUBLE-SAT is in NP.\n",

The formula $\\phi'$ will be satisfiable with at least two distinct assignments if and only if the original formula $\\phi$ is satisfiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce a new variable $y$ not in $\\phi$, and let $\\phi'$ be $\\phi \\land (y \\lor \\neg y)$. This creates two satisfiable versions of any satisfiable assignment to $\\phi$, one where $y$ is TRUE and one where $y$ is FALSE.\n",

    "\n",
    "Conversely, if $\\phi$ is not satisfiable, no assignment to the $x_i$'s can make $\\phi$ evaluate to TRUE, and thus $\\phi'$ cannot have two satisfying assignments since $\\phi$ is part of $\\phi'$.\n",
