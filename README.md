Unofficial solutions to the CS PhD qualifier exam at Georgia Tech College of Computing, School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE).

Please feel free to make pull requests.

The sample exams can be found [here](https://cse.gatech.edu/past-qualifying-exams). Note that "ML" is the same as "Data Analysis."



## Topics in the Qual Exam
